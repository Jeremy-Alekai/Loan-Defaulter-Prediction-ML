# Introduction

This project aims to predict whether a borrower will default on their home equity loan based on their demographic and credit history. Predicting loan defaults can be crucial for lenders to make informed decisions and manage risks. This project can be helpful for both lenders and borrowers in understanding the factors that contribute to loan defaults.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). The dataset contains information on home equity loans from 5 lenders in 1994. It includes demographic information, credit history, and loan information. The dataset is available on Kaggle and can be accessed through this link: https://www.kaggle.com/ajay1735/hmeq-data

# Challenges

One of the challenges in working with this dataset could be dealing with missing or incomplete data in some rows. Another challenge could be dealing with imbalanced classes, as defaults may be a relatively small percentage of the total. Additionally, betting odds data may not be readily available for this dataset.
